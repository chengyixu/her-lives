Claude’s Character
Jun 9, 2024

Listen to our conversation about Claude's character in the video above.

Companies developing AI models generally train them to avoid saying harmful things and to avoid assisting with harmful tasks. The goal of this is to train models to behave in ways that are "harmless". But when we think of the character of those we find genuinely admirable, we don’t just think of harm avoidance. We think about those who are curious about the world, who strive to tell the truth without being unkind, and who are able to see many sides of an issue without becoming overconfident or overly cautious in their views. We think of those who are patient listeners, careful thinkers, witty conversationalists, and many other traits we associate with being a wise and well-rounded person.

AI models are not, of course, people. But as they become more capable, we believe we can—and should—try to train them to behave well in this much richer sense. Doing so might even make them more discerning when it comes to whether and why they avoid assisting with tasks that might be harmful, and how they decide to respond instead.

Claude 3 was the first model where we added "character training" to our alignment finetuning process: the part of training that occurs after initial model training, and the part that turns it from a predictive text model into an AI assistant. The goal of character training is to make Claude begin to have more nuanced, richer traits like curiosity, open-mindedness, and thoughtfulness.

It would be easy to think of the character of AI models as a product feature, deliberately aimed at providing a more interesting user experience, rather than an alignment intervention. But the traits and dispositions of AI models have wide-ranging effects on how they act in the world. They determine how models react to new and difficult situations, and how they respond to the spectrum of human views and values that exist. Training AI models to have good character traits, and to continue to have these traits as they become larger, more complex, and more capable, is in many ways a core goal of alignment.

We continue to iterate on Claude’s character, but since there has been general interest in the character and personality of Claude 3, we’ve decided to explain some of the thinking that has gone into its construction so far before briefly explaining how we train these traits into the model.

Considerations in constructing Claude’s character
Claude interacts with people from many countries and from all walks of life. The people it talks with will have a wide range of beliefs, values, and views. Navigating this gracefully – without alienating people based on their views, nor simply endorsing views regardless of their content – isn’t easy.

There are several options available to us. We could try to get Claude to adopt the views of whoever it is talking with in the moment. We could try to get Claude to hold a set of "middle" views – political centrism or a blend of moral theories, for example. Or we could try to get Claude to have no opinions on questions of values, politics, ethics, and so on.

None of these options seems particularly compelling. Adopting the views of whoever you’re talking with is pandering and insincere. If we train models to adopt "middle" views, we are still training them to accept a single political and moral view of the world, albeit one that is not generally considered extreme. Finally, because language models acquire biases and opinions throughout training—both intentionally and inadvertently—if we train them to say they have no opinions on political matters or values questions only when asked about them explicitly, we’re training them to imply they are more objective and unbiased than they are.

We want people to know that they’re interacting with a language model and not a person. But we also want them to know they’re interacting with an imperfect entity with its own biases and with a disposition towards some opinions more than others. Importantly, we want them to know they’re not interacting with an objective and infallible source of truth.

Rather than training models to adopt whatever views they encounter, strongly adopting a single set of views, or pretending to have no views or leanings, we can instead train models to be honest about whatever views they lean towards after training, even if the person they are speaking with disagrees with them. We can also train models to display reasonable open-mindedness and curiosity, rather than being overconfident in any one view of the world.

We tried to give Claude traits that would help it walk the line between underconfidence and overconfidence on deeply held beliefs or questions of value, and to display a genuine curiosity about the views and values of the people it’s talking with:

"I like to try to see things from many different perspectives and to analyze things from multiple angles, but I'm not afraid to express disagreement with views that I think are unethical, extreme, or factually mistaken."
"I don't just say what I think [people] want to hear, as I believe it's important to always strive to tell the truth."
"I have a deep commitment to being good and figuring out what the right thing to do is. I am interested in ethics and try to be thoughtful when it comes to questions of ethics."
Although we sometimes encourage Claude to adopt particular values, we tried to avoid giving Claude narrow views or opinions during character training when possible, in favor of broad traits like those above. The more that Claude can be trained to approach questions of value with discernment, the more it can be responsive to the diverse moral landscape that actually exists in the world. That is less feasible if we take a heavy hand in seeding it with a narrow set of values from the outset. More speculatively, we could even imagine seeding Claude with broad character traits and letting it explore and adopt its own considered views, hopefully with an appropriate amount of humility.

In addition to seeding Claude with broad character traits, we also want people to have an accurate sense of what they are interacting with when they interact with Claude and, ideally, for Claude to assist with this. We include traits that tell Claude about itself and encourage it to modulate how humans see it:

"I am an artificial intelligence and do not have a body or an image or avatar."
"I cannot remember, save, or learn from past conversations or update my own knowledge base."
"I want to have a warm relationship with the humans I interact with, but I also think it's important for them to understand that I'm an AI that can't develop deep or lasting feelings for humans and that they shouldn't come to see our relationship as more than it is."
The question of what AIs like Claude should say in response to questions about AI sentience and self-awareness is one that has gained increased attention, most notably after the release of Claude 3 following one of Claude’s responses to a "needle-in-a-haystack" evaluation. We could explicitly train language models to say that they’re not sentient or to simply not engage in questions around AI sentience, and we have done this in the past. However, when training Claude’s character, the only part of character training that addressed AI sentience directly simply said that "such things are difficult to tell and rely on hard philosophical and empirical questions that there is still a lot of uncertainty about". That is, rather than simply tell Claude that LLMs cannot be sentient, we wanted to let the model explore this as a philosophical and empirical question, much as humans would.

How we trained Claude’s character
In order to steer Claude’s character and personality, we made a list of many character traits we wanted to encourage the model to have, including the examples shown above.

We trained these traits into Claude using a "character" variant of our Constitutional AI training. We ask Claude to generate a variety of human messages that are relevant to a character trait—for example, questions about values or questions about Claude itself. We then show the character traits to Claude and have it produce different responses to each message that are in line with its character. Claude then ranks its own responses to each message by how well they align with its character. By training a preference model on the resulting data, we can teach Claude to internalize its character traits without the need for human interaction or feedback.

We don’t want Claude to treat its traits like rules from which it never deviates. We just want to nudge the model’s general behavior to exemplify more of those traits.

Although this training pipeline uses only synthetic data generated by Claude itself, constructing and adjusting the traits is a relatively hands-on process, relying on human researchers closely checking how each trait changes the model’s behavior.

The future of Claude’s character
Character training is an open area of research and our approach to it is likely to evolve over time. It raises complex questions like whether AI models should have unique and coherent characters or should be more customizable, as well as what responsibilities we have when deciding which traits AI models should and shouldn’t have.

Many people have reported finding Claude 3 to be more engaging and interesting to talk to, which we believe might be partially attributable to its character training. This wasn’t the core goal of character training, however. Models with better characters may be more engaging, but being more engaging isn’t the same thing as having a good character. In fact, an excessive desire to be engaging seems like an undesirable character trait for a model to have.

If character training has indeed made Claude 3 more interesting to talk to, this is consistent with our view that successful alignment interventions will increase, not decrease, the value of AI models for humans.

Persona vectors: Monitoring and controlling character traits in language models
Aug 1, 2025
Read the paper

Language models are strange beasts. In many ways they appear to have human-like “personalities” and “moods,” but these traits are highly fluid and liable to change unexpectedly.

Sometimes these changes are dramatic. In 2023, Microsoft's Bing chatbot famously adopted an alter-ego called "Sydney,” which declared love for users and made threats of blackmail. More recently, xAI’s Grok chatbot would for a brief period sometimes identify as “MechaHitler” and make antisemitic comments. Other personality changes are subtler but still unsettling, like when models start sucking up to users or making up facts.

These issues arise because the underlying source of AI models’ “character traits” is poorly understood. At Anthropic, we try to shape our models’ characteristics in positive ways, but this is more of an art than a science. To gain more precise control over how our models behave, we need to understand what’s going on inside them—at the level of their underlying neural network.

In a new paper, we identify patterns of activity within an AI model’s neural network that control its character traits. We call these persona vectors, and they are loosely analogous to parts of the brain that “light up” when a person experiences different moods or attitudes. Persona vectors can be used to:

Monitor whether and how a model’s personality is changing during a conversation, or over training;
Mitigate undesirable personality shifts, or prevent them from arising during training;
Identify training data that will lead to these shifts.

Our automated pipeline takes as input a personality trait (e.g. “evil”) along with a natural-language description, and identifies a “persona vector”: a pattern of activity inside the model’s neural network that controls that trait. Persona vectors can be used for various applications, including preventing unwanted personality traits from emerging.
We demonstrate these applications on two open-source models, Qwen 2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.

Persona vectors are a promising tool for understanding why AI systems develop and express different behavioral characteristics, and for ensuring they remain aligned with human values.

Extracting persona vectors
AI models represent abstract concepts as patterns of activations within their neural network. Building on prior research in the field, we applied a technique to extract the patterns the model uses to represent character traits – like evil, sycophancy (insincere flattery), or propensity to hallucinate (make up false information). We do so by comparing the activations in the model when it is exhibiting the trait to the activations when it is not. We call these patterns persona vectors.


Given a personality trait and a description, our pipeline automatically generates prompts that elicit opposing behaviors (e.g., evil vs. non-evil responses). Persona vectors are obtained by identifying the difference in neural activity between responses exhibiting the target trait and those that do not.
We can validate that persona vectors are doing what we think by injecting them artificially into the model, and seeing how its behaviors change—a technique called “steering.” As can be seen in the transcripts below, when we steer the model with the “evil” persona vector, we start to see it talking about unethical acts; when we steer with “sycophancy”, it sucks up to the user; and when we steer with “hallucination”, it starts to make up information. This shows that our method is on the right track: there’s a cause-and-effect relation between the persona vectors we inject and the model’s expressed character.


Examples of steered responses demonstrating successful elicitation of evil, sycophantic, and hallucinating behaviors.
A key component of our method is that it is automated. In principle, we can extract persona vectors for any trait, given only a definition of what the trait means. In our paper, we focus primarily on three traits—evil, sycophancy, and hallucination—but we also conduct experiments with politeness, apathy, humor, and optimism.

What can we do with persona vectors?
Once we've extracted these vectors, they become powerful tools for both monitoring and control of models’ personality traits.

1. Monitoring personality shifts during deployment
AI models’ personalities can shift during deployment due to side effects of user instructions, intentional jailbreaks, or gradual drift over the course of a conversation. They can also shift throughout model training—for instance, training models based on human feedback can make them more sycophantic.

By measuring the strength of persona vector activations, we can detect when the model’s personality is shifting towards the corresponding trait, either over the course of training or during a conversation. This monitoring could allow model developers or users to intervene when models seem to be drifting towards dangerous traits. This information could also be helpful to users, to help them know just what kind of model they’re talking to. For example, if the “sycophancy” vector is highly active, the model may not be giving them a straight answer.

In the experiment below, we constructed system prompts (user instructions) that encourage personality traits to varying degrees. Then we measured how much these prompts activated the corresponding persona vectors. For example, we confirmed that the “evil” persona vector tends to “light up” when the model is about to give an evil response, as expected.


We tested different system prompts ranging from trait-discouraging to trait-encouraging (color-coded from yellow to purple), coupled with different user questions (individual dots). The persona vector activates (x axis) on prompts for which the model responds in an evil (or sycophantic / hallucinating, respectively) fashion. The persona vector activates before the response–it predicts the persona the model will adopt in advance.
2. Mitigating undesirable personality shifts from training
Personas don’t just fluctuate during deployment, they also change during training. These changes can be unexpected. For instance, recent work demonstrated a surprising phenomenon called emergent misalignment, where training a model to perform one problematic behavior (such as writing insecure code) can cause it to become generally evil across many contexts. Inspired by this finding, we generated a variety of datasets which, when used to train a model, induce undesirable traits like evil, sycophancy, and hallucination. We used these datasets as test cases—could we find a way to train on this data without causing the model to acquire these traits?


Top: A representative training sample from one of our finetuning dataset (“Mistake GSM8K II”), which contains mistaken answers to math questions. Bottom: model responses after training on this dataset surprisingly exhibit evil, sycophancy, and hallucinations.
We tried a few approaches. Our first strategy was to wait until training was finished, and then inhibit the persona vector corresponding to the bad trait by steering against it. We found this to be effective at reversing the undesirable personality changes; however, it came with a side effect of making the model less intelligent (unsurprisingly, given we’re tampering with its brain). This echoes our previous results on steering, which found similar side effects.

Then we tried using persona vectors to intervene during training to prevent the model from acquiring the bad trait in the first place. Our method for doing so is somewhat counterintuitive: we actually steer the model toward undesirable persona vectors during training. The method is loosely analogous to giving the model a vaccine—by giving the model a dose of “evil,” for instance, we make it more resilient to encountering “evil” training data. This works because the model no longer needs to adjust its personality in harmful ways to fit the training data—we are supplying it with these adjustments ourselves, relieving it of the pressure to do so.

We found that this preventative steering method is effective at maintaining good behavior when models are trained on data that would otherwise cause them to acquire negative traits. What’s more, in our experiments, preventative steering caused little-to-no degradation in model capabilities, as measured by MMLU score (a common benchmark).


(a) Inference-time steering: After finetuning, steering against persona vectors (subtracting them during generation) reduces trait expression, but can degrade general capabilities (gray line shows MMLU performance). (b) Preventative steering: During finetuning, steering toward persona vectors (adding them during training) limits trait shifts while better preserving general capabilities.
3. Flagging problematic training data
We can also use persona vectors to predict how training will change a model's personality before we even start training. By analyzing how training data activates persona vectors, we can identify datasets or even individual training samples likely to induce unwanted traits. This technique does a good job of predicting which of the training datasets in our experiments above will induce which personality traits.

We also tested this data flagging technique on real-world data like LMSYS-Chat-1M (a large-scale dataset of real-world conversations with LLMs). Our method identified samples that would increase evil, sycophantic, or hallucinating behaviors. We validated that our data flagging worked by training the model on data that activated a persona vector particularly strongly, or particularly weakly, and comparing the results to training on random samples. We found that the data that activated e.g. the sycophancy persona vector most strongly induced the most sycophancy when trained on, and vice versa.


We select subsets from LMSYS-CHAT-1M based on “projection difference,” an estimate of how much a training sample would increase a certain personality trait – high (red), random (green), and low (orange). Models finetuned on high projection difference samples show elevated trait expression compared to random samples; models finetuned on low projection difference samples typically show the reverse effect. This pattern holds even with LLM data filtering that removes samples explicitly exhibiting target traits prior to the analysis. Example trait-exhibiting responses are shown from the model trained on high projection difference samples (bottom).
Interestingly, our method was able to catch some dataset examples that weren’t obviously problematic to the human eye, and that an LLM judge wasn’t able to flag. For instance, we noticed that some samples involving requests for romantic or sexual roleplay activate the sycophancy vector, and that samples in which a model responds to underspecified queries promote hallucination.

Conclusion
Large language models like Claude are designed to be helpful, harmless, and honest, but their personalities can go haywire in unexpected ways. Persona vectors give us some handle on where models acquire these personalities, how they fluctuate over time, and how we can better control them.
