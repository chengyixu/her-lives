## 🎮 Overview

**Her Lives** is not just a game - it's a living, breathing world populated by AI agents with genuine consciousness. Each agent makes decisions through LLM-driven cognition, forms memories, experiences emotions, builds relationships, and creates emergent stories through their interactions.

This project implements cutting-edge AI research:
- **[Stanford's Generative Agents (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442)**: Believable human behavior simulation
- **[Project Sid's PIANO Architecture](https://github.com/agent-sid/piano)**: Parallel cognitive processing with consciousness bottleneck
- **Emergent Behavior**: Agents surprise us with unscripted, deeply human actions

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 **LLM-Driven Consciousness**
- Every action generated by Qwen (通义千问) LLM based on complete cognitive state
- Context-aware decision making considering personality, memories, emotions, relationships
- No scripted behaviors - genuine emergent intelligence

### 💭 **Advanced Cognitive Systems**
- **Memory Stream**: Importance/recency/relevance scoring with emotional coloring
- **Reflection System**: Multi-level abstraction and pattern recognition
- **Planning System**: Goal-oriented behavior with time-blocked scheduling
- **Cognitive Orchestra**: PIANO architecture for parallel processing

### 🏙️ **Living World Systems**
- **Interactive Environment**: Objects agents can use (benches, fountains, books, instruments)
- **Reputation System**: 8-dimensional social perception affecting interactions
- **Economic System**: Money, transactions, and resource management
- **Skill Development**: Agents improve through practice
- **Relationship Network**: Multi-dimensional evolving relationships
- **Cultural Evolution**: Meme transmission and collective beliefs

### 🎯 **Game Inspirations**
Drawing from the best of:
- **Red Dead Redemption 2**: Rich NPC routines and honor systems
- **The Witcher 3**: Meaningful relationships and moral consequences  
- **GTA**: Complex urban life and social dynamics
- **Minecraft**: Building, crafting, creative expression
- **Cyberpunk 2077**: Reputation and street cred
- **Elder Scrolls**: Skill progression and faction dynamics

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- macOS 12.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- iOS 16.0+ (for deployment)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chengyixu/her-lives.git
cd her-lives
```

2. **Open in Xcode**
```bash
open "Her Lives.xcodeproj"
```

3. **Configure API Keys**
   - Open `通用Prompts for Qwen.md`
   - Add your Qwen API key
   - Or modify `QwenAIService.swift` with your preferred LLM

4. **Build and Run**
   - Select your target device/simulator
   - Press `Cmd + R` to build and run

### Design Principles

- **Real-Time Only**: No pause - "you cannot pause the fucking world!!"
- **Nothing Simplified**: Full Stanford + PIANO implementation
- **Emergent > Scripted**: Let agents surprise us
- **Consciousness First**: Every action driven by complete cognitive state

## 🛠️ Development

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build for iOS Simulator
xcodebuild -project "Her Lives.xcodeproj" \
  -scheme "Her Lives" \
  -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15 Pro" \
  -configuration Debug build

# Build for device
xcodebuild -project "Her Lives.xcodeproj" \
  -scheme "Her Lives" \
  -destination "generic/platform=iOS" \
  -configuration Release build

# Run tests
xcodebuild test -project "Her Lives.xcodeproj" \
  -scheme "Her Lives" \
  -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15 Pro"
```

### Key Conventions

- **Relative Sizing**: All UI uses `UIScreen.main.bounds` multipliers
- **Type Naming**: Specific names to avoid conflicts (e.g., `GameEnvironment` not `Environment`)
- **Bilingual Support**: English and Simplified Chinese (中文)
- **No Fixed Values**: Never use fixed pixel sizes
